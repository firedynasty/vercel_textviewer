Summary of Changes - 2025-02-10

1. Tag-based File Filtering ($tag system)
   - Added $tag extraction from text/markdown file content
   - Tag chips appear in the ControlBar header after files load
   - Clicking a tag filters the sidebar to show only files containing that tag
   - Clicking again clears the filter
   - Tag search input lets you filter which tag chips are displayed
   - Tags extracted lazily: local files scanned after load, Dropbox files scanned on first open
   - Tag prefix uses $ symbol (chose over # and @ to avoid conflicts with markdown headings and email addresses)

2. Removed Features
   - Removed Cloud Notes button and component
   - Removed Reading Aids button and reading guide ruler

3. Bug Fixes
   - Fixed sidebar filter showing untagged files (PDFs, images, RTFs) when a tag filter is active
   - Untagged files are now hidden during tag filtering

4. UI Cleanup
   - Removed "Select Files" button from ControlBar
